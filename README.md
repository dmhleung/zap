# zap
z-value based covariate-adaptive testing

### Installation

To install the package in R,  use the command (after installing the devtools package):
`````````
devtools::install_github('dmhleung/zap')
`````````
### This is a preliminary version of the package, but it should function well enough to perform the multiple testing methods described in the paper.

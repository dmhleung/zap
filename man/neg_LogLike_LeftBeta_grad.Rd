\title{negative left beta log-likelihood gradient}
\usage{
neg_LogLike_LeftBeta_grad(beta_l, U, X_tilde, gamma_l)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta_l}{The first shape parameter}

\item{U}{A vector of u-values to evaluate the beta density on}

\item{X_tilde}{A matrix of the covariates augmented with 1's as intercepts. Should have the same number of rows as the length of U}

\item{gamma_l}{The second shape parameter, should be greater than 2}
}
\value{
the evaluated negative log likelihood gradient, a vector of dimension p
}
